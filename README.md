## 🚀 Run on Replit (Recommended)

No local setup is required. The project is designed to run entirely on Replit.

### Steps

1. **[Remix this project →](https://replit.com/@kodylow/ReplitPrototyper?v=1)**
2. **Set Secrets** (Environment Variables) in Replit:
   - `DATABASE_URL` (Replit-provided Postgres or your connection string)
   - `SESSION_SECRET`
   - Optional: `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `PUBLIC_OBJECT_SEARCH_PATHS`, `PRIVATE_OBJECT_DIR`, `REPLIT_CLIENT_ID`, `REPLIT_CLIENT_SECRET`
3. **Initialize the database**
   - Open the Shell and run: `npm run db:push`
4. **Run the app**
   - Click the Run button in Replit (or run `npm run dev` in the Shell)
5. **Open the app**
   - Use the Replit Webview or the provided URL (e.g., `https://<your-repl>.replit.app`)

## 🔧 Development Workflow

### Available Scripts

```bash
# Development
npm run dev          # Start development server with hot reload
npm run build        # Build for production
npm run start        # Start production server

# Database
npm run db:push      # Push schema changes to database
npm run check        # TypeScript type checking
```
